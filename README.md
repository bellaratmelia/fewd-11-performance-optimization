# fewd-11-performance-optimization
Trying out gulp.js to automate tasks that optimize assets, minify scripts, etc

- can't get the request down to less than 24 :( Unless I created an SVG for the logo and embed it inline but I decided to focus on next project instead
- initially stuggles with Gulp as it keeps throwing me vague error. After mentor session with Andrew, turns out it's because I used bleeding edge version of node.js. Works fine after I installed the stable version.
- Used tinyjpg.com and tinypng.com for image optimization. Tried to use gulp-image, but it keeps throwing me EPIPE error thingy.
